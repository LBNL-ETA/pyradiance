/*
 *	Regrettably, the algorithm for determining a cube's location
 *  with respect to a sphere is not simple.  First, a quick test is 
 *  made to determine if the sphere and the bounding sphere of the cube 
 *  are disjoint.  This of course means no intersection.  Failing this,
 *  we determine if the cube lies inside the sphere.  The cube is
 *  entirely inside if the bounding sphere on the cube is
 *  contained within our sphere.  This means no intersection.  Otherwise,
 *  if the cube radius is smaller than the sphere's and the cube center is
 *  inside the sphere, we assume intersection.  If these tests fail,
 *  we proceed as follows.
 *	The sphere center is located in relation to the 6 cube faces,
 *  and one of four things is done depending on the number of
 *  planes the center lies between:
 *
 *	0:  The sphere is closest to a cube corner, find the
 *		distance to that corner.
 *
 *	1:  The sphere is closest to a cube edge, find this
 *		distance.
 *
 *	2:  The sphere is closest to a cube face, find the distance.
 *
 *	3:  The sphere has its center inside the cube.
 *
 *	In cases 0-2, if the closest part of the cube is within
 *  the radius distance from the sphere center, we have intersection.
 *  If it is not, the cube must be outside the sphere.
 *	In case 3, there must be intersection, and no further
 *  tests are necessary.
