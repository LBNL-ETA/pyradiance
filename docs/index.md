# Getting Started

Pyradiance is a Python wrapper to the validated 
[RADIANCE](https://github.com/LBNL-ETA/Radiance/tree/master) ray-tracing system 
that mimics closely the RADIANCE CLI. See [Reference](reference) for a complete 
list of supported RADIANCE functions.

## Installation

Pyradiance can be installed via pip from PyPI:
```
pip install pyradiance
```
This command will install also Radiance binaries and libraries files, 
setting up the PATH environment. You don't need to install Radiance 
separately. If you already have RADIANCE installed 
in your system, pyradiance won't interfere with it either.

### Requirements
Python >= 3.8

## Quickstart

For new users, here is a quickstart [tutorial](tutorials.md)
